# Placeholder Sources and Javadoc

This archive is **intentionally minimal** and includes this README only.
It exists to satisfy Maven Central's requirement for `-sources.jar` and `-javadoc.jar`.

> **Why is this archive minimal?**
> Older releases were built with a legacy toolchain that cannot be reproduced today.
> To keep historical binaries available on Maven Central while staying compliant with repository rules, we publish this minimal archive instead.
